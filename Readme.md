# Image Processing Algorithms 

These algorithms are implemented for a specific course at USC. The algorithms are divided into 5 folder, each of the folders contain different algorithms. The example usage can be seen after the makefile is run. The implemenetation is performed using Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 11. The makefile can be run by using the below command in the specific folder:\
```bash
make
```
The matlab files were run using Windows with MATLAB 2019b.\
Matlab commands can be run using the below command in the MATLAB sub folder \
```MATLAB
Readme
```
For the execution of Python files, go through the readme.txt files in the folder\
The description of each of the folder is given below:\
**1**:
- Bilinear Demosaicing 
- Histogram Manipulation
- B&W Image Denoising 
- Color Image Denoising  
  
**2**:
- Edge Detection
